        "summary": "The notes are designed for investors who are seeking quarterly contingent periodic interest payments (as described in more detail below), as well as a return of principal if the notes are redeemed prior to maturity. Investors should be willing to have their notes redeemed prior to maturity, be willing to forego any potential to participate in any increase in the level of the Reference Assets and be willing to lose some or all of their principal at maturity. The notes will pay a Contingent Coupon on each Contingent Coupon Payment Date at the Contingent Interest Rate of 1.900% per quarter (approximately 7.60% per annum) if the closing level of each of the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund, the Russell 2000 Index, and the S&P 500 Index (each, a &quot;Reference Asset&quot; and, collectively, the &quot;Reference Assets&quot;) on the applicable quarterly Observation Date is greater than or equal to its Coupon Barrier Level. However, if the closing level of any Reference Asset is less than its Coupon Barrier Level on an Observation Date, the notes will not pay the Contingent Coupon for that Observation Date. Beginning on March 04, 2025, Bank of Montreal may, in its discretion, elect to call the notes in whole, but not in part, on any Observation Date (an &quot;Issuer Call&quot;). If Bank of Montreal elects to call the notes, investors will receive their principal amount plus any Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Contingent Coupon Payment Date following the Issuer Call (the &quot;Call Settlement Date&quot;). After the notes are redeemed pursuant to an Issuer Call, investors will not receive any additional payments in respect of the notes. The notes do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity. Instead, if the notes are not redeemed pursuant to an Issuer Call, the payment at maturity will be based on the Final Level of each Reference Asset and whether the Final Level of any Reference Asset has declined from its Initial Level to below its Trigger Level on the Valuation Date (a &ldquo;Trigger Event&rdquo;), as described below. If the notes are not subject to an Issuer Call and a Trigger Event has occurred, investors will lose 1% of the principal amount for each 1% decrease in the level of the Least Performing Reference Asset (as defined below) from its Initial Level to its Final Level. In such a case, you will receive a cash amount at maturity that is less than the principal amount. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to a hypothetical direct investment in the Reference Assets. The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. All payments on the notes are subject to the credit risk of Bank of Montreal.",

If the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to 80% of its respective initial index value, which we refer to as the respective downside threshold value, you will receive the stated principal amount for each security that you hold at maturity plus the upside payment of $115 to $135 per security (to be determined on the pricing date).  However, if the final index value of either underlying index is less than its respective downside threshold value, you will be exposed to the decline in the level of the worst performing underlying index beyond the buffer amount of 20%, and you will lose some or a significant portion of your initial investment.  The payment at maturity may be significantly less than the stated principal amount, and you could lose up to 80% of your investment.  Because the payment at maturity on the securities is based on the worst performing of the underlying indices, a decline in either final index value below 80% of its respective initial index value will result in a loss on your investment, even if the other underlying index has appreciated or has not declined as much. The securities are for investors who seek an equity index-based return and who are willing to risk their principal, risk exposure to the worst performing of two underlying indices and forgo current income and returns above the fixed upside payment in exchange for the upside payment and buffer features that in each case apply to a limited range of performance of the worst performing underlying index.  The securities are notes issued as part of MSFL&#8217;s Series A Global Medium-Term Notes Program.  All payments are subject to our credit risk.  If we default on our obligations, you could lose some or all of your investment.

The securities will not be redeemed early on any early redemption date if the index closing value of any underlying index is below its respective call threshold level on the related determination date. The securities do not guarantee the repayment of principal and do not provide for the regular payment of interest.

No further payments will be made on the securities once they have been redeemed.  At maturity, if the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to its respective call threshold level, investors will receive a fixed positive return, as set forth below.  If the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final index value of any underlying index is less than its respective call threshold level but the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to 70% of its respective initial index value, which we refer to as the respective downside threshold level, investors will receive a payment at maturity of $1,000 per $1,000 security.  However, if the securities are not redeemed prior to maturity and the final index value of any underlying index is less than its respective downside threshold level, investors will be exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlying index on a 1-to-1 basis, and will receive a payment at maturity that is less than 70% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero.

Payments on the Notes depend on the performance of the Russell 2000<sup>&#174;</sup> Index (the Underlying). A Contingent coupon rate of 6.85% per annum (3.425% semi-annually) is payable semi-annually if the closing level of the Underlying on the applicable Observation Date is greater than or equal to 70.00% of its Starting Value, assuming the Notes have not been called. Beginning on March 25, 2025, the Notes can be called semi-annually at the issuer's option. If the Underlying declines by more than 30% from its Starting Value at maturity, your investment will be subject to 1:1 downside exposure to decreases in the value of the Underlying, with up to 100% of the principal at risk; otherwise, at maturity, you will receive the principal amount. At maturity, you will also receive a final Contingent Coupon Payment if the closing level of the Underlying on the final Observation Date is greater than or equal to 70.00% of its Starting Value.",

The Trigger PLUS will pay no interest, do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity and have the terms described in the accompanying product supplement for PLUS, index supplement and prospectus, as supplemented or modified by this document. The payment at maturity on the Trigger PLUS will be based on the value of the worst performing of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Russell 2000 Index and the Nasdaq-100 Index, which we refer to as the underlying indices. At maturity, if each underlying index has appreciated in value, investors will receive the stated principal amount of their investment plus leveraged upside performance of the worst performing underlying index, subject to the maximum upside payment at maturity. If any of the underlying indices depreciates in value, but the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to 70% of the respective initial index value, which we refer to as the respective trigger level, investors will receive the stated principal amount of their investment plus a positive return equal to 50% of the absolute value of the performance of the worst performing underlying index, which will be effectively limited to a 15% return. However, if the final index value of any underlying index is less than its respective trigger level, the absolute return feature will no longer be available and instead investors will lose a significant portion or all of their investment, resulting in a loss of 1% for every 1% decline in the worst performing underlying index from its initial index value. Investors may lose their entire initial investment in the Trigger PLUS.  Because the payment at maturity of the Trigger PLUS is based on the worst performing of the underlying indices, a decline in any underlying index below its respective trigger level will result in a significant loss of your investment, even if the other underlying indices have appreciated or have not declined as much. The Trigger PLUS are for investors who seek an equity index-based return and who are willing to risk their principal, risk exposure to the worst performing of three underlying indices and forgo current income and upside above the maximum upside payment at maturity in exchange for the leverage and absolute return features that in each case apply to a limited range of performance of the worst performing underlying index. The Trigger PLUS are notes issued as part of MSFL\u2019s Series A Global Medium-Term Notes program.",

The Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000.00 and whole multiples of $1,000.00 in excess thereof. The Notes are not guaranteed by any entity other than Bank of America Corporation. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. The Notes are linked to the least performing of the Underlyings and have a contingent coupon rate of 8.75% per annum (2.1875% per quarter) payable quarterly if the closing level of each Underlying on the applicable Observation Date is greater than or equal to 70.00% of its Starting Value, assuming the Notes have not been called. The Notes have an approximate 3 year term if not called prior to maturity. The Notes are callable quarterly at our option for an amount equal to the principal amount plus the relevant Contingent Coupon Payment, if otherwise payable. The Notes are subject to a 1:1 downside exposure to decreases in the value of the Least Performing Underlying if the Ending Value of the Least Performing Underlying is less than its Threshold Value at maturity.

However, if the securities have not previously been redeemed and the final share price is less than the downside threshold price, investors will be exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlying stock, as compared to the initial share price, on a 1-to-1 basis. In this case, the payment at maturity will be less than 70% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero.",

Instead, the securities will pay a contingent quarterly coupon but only if the index closing value of each of the Nasdaq-100 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at or above the respective then-applicable coupon barrier level, on the related observation date. If the index closing value of any underlying index is less than the then-applicable coupon barrier level for such index on any observation date, we will pay no coupon for the related quarterly period.  It is possible that the index closing value of one or more underlying indices will remain below the respective then-applicable coupon barrier level(s) for extended periods of time or even throughout the entire term of the securities so that you will receive few or no contingent quarterly coupons during the entire term of the securities. Even if an underlying index were to be at or above the then-applicable coupon barrier level for such index on some quarterly observation dates, it may fluctuate below the respective then-applicable coupon barrier level on others. In addition, even if one underlying index were to be at or above the then-applicable coupon barrier level for such index on all quarterly observation dates, you will receive a contingent quarterly coupon only with respect to the observation dates on which the other underlying indices are also at or above their respective then-applicable coupon barrier levels, if any. In addition, beginning on March 25, 2026, we will redeem the securities on any quarterly redemption date, for a redemption payment equal to the sum of the stated principal amount plus any contingent quarterly coupon otherwise due with respect to the related observation date, if and only if the output of a risk neutral valuation model on a business day, as selected by the calculation agent, that is no earlier than three business days before the observation date preceding such redemption date and no later than such observation date, based on the inputs indicated under \u201cCall feature\u201d on the cover page, indicates that redeeming on such date is economically rational for us as compared to not redeeming on such date.  An early redemption of the securities will not automatically occur based on the performance of the underlying indices.  At maturity, if the securities have not been previously redeemed and if the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to 70% of the respective initial index value, which we refer to as the downside threshold level, the payment at maturity will be the stated principal amount and the related contingent quarterly coupon.  If, however, the final index value of any underlying index is less than its downside threshold level, investors will be exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlying index on a 1-to-1 basis and will receive a payment at maturity that is less than 70% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero.",

        "summary": "The securities provide an opportunity for investors to earn a quarterly contingent coupon payment, which is an amount equal to at least $26.125 (at least 2.6125% of the stated principal amount) per security (to be determined on the pricing date), with respect to each quarterly valuation date on which the closing price of the underlying shares is greater than or equal to 70.00% of the initial share price, which we refer to as the downside threshold price. The quarterly contingent coupon payment, if any, will be payable quarterly on the relevant contingent coupon payment date, which is the third business day after the related valuation date or, in the case of the quarterly contingent coupon payment, if any, with respect to the final valuation date, the maturity date. If the closing price of the underlying shares is less than the downside threshold price on any valuation date, investors will receive no quarterly contingent coupon payment for the related quarterly period. It is possible that the closing price of the underlying shares could be below the downside threshold price on most or all of the valuation dates so that you will receive few or no quarterly contingent coupon payments. We refer to these payments as contingent because there is no guarantee that you will receive a payment on any contingent coupon payment date. Even if the closing price of the underlying shares was at or above the downside threshold price on some quarterly valuation dates, the closing price of the underlying shares may fluctuate below the downside threshold price on others. If the closing price of the underlying shares is greater than or equal to the initial share price on any potential redemption date (beginning approximately three months after the issue date), the securities will be automatically redeemed for an early redemption payment equal to the stated principal amount  plus  the quarterly contingent coupon payment with respect to the related potential redemption date. If the securities have not previously been automatically redeemed and the final share price is greater than or equal to the downside threshold price, the payment at maturity will also be the sum of the stated principal amount and the quarterly contingent coupon payment with respect to the final valuation date. However, if the securities have not previously been automatically redeemed and the final share price is less than the downside threshold price, investors will be exposed to the decline in the closing price of the underlying shares, as compared to the initial share price, on a 1-to-1 basis. Under these circumstances, the payment at maturity will be (i) the stated principal amount  plus  (ii) (a) the stated principal amount  times  (b) the share return, which means that the payment at maturity will be less than 70.00% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero. Investors in the securities must be willing to accept the risk of losing their entire principal and also the risk of receiving few or no quarterly contingent coupon payments over the term of the securities. In addition, investors will not participate in any appreciation of the underlying shares.",

Instead, the securities will pay a contingent quarterly coupon but only if the index closing value of each of the Nasdaq-100 Index, the Russell 2000 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is at or above the respective then-applicable coupon barrier level, on the related observation date.  If the index closing value of any underlying index is less than the then-applicable coupon barrier level for such index on any observation date, we will pay no coupon for the related quarterly period.  It is possible that the index closing value of one or more underlying indices will remain below the respective then-applicable coupon barrier level(s) for extended periods of time or even throughout the entire term of the securities so that you will receive few or no contingent quarterly coupons during the entire term of the securities. Even if an underlying index were to be at or above the then-applicable coupon barrier level for such index on some quarterly observation dates, it may fluctuate below the respective then-applicable coupon barrier level on others.  In addition, even if one underlying index were to be at or above the then-applicable coupon barrier level for such index on all quarterly observation dates, you will receive a contingent quarterly coupon only with respect to the observation dates on which the other underlying indices are also at or above their respective then-applicable coupon barrier levels, if any. In addition, beginning on March 25, 2026, we will redeem the securities on any quarterly redemption date, for a redemption payment equal to the sum of the stated principal amount plus any contingent quarterly coupon otherwise due with respect to the related observation date, if and only if the output of a risk neutral valuation model on a business day, as selected by the calculation agent, that is no earlier than three business days before the observation date preceding such redemption date and no later than such observation date, based on the inputs indicated under \u201cCall feature\u201d on the cover page, indicates that redeeming on such date is economically rational for us as compared to not redeeming on such date.  An early redemption of the securities will not automatically occur based on the performance of the underlying indices.  At maturity, if the securities have not been previously redeemed and if the final index value of each underlying index is greater than or equal to 70% of the respective initial index value, which we refer to as the downside threshold level, the payment at maturity will be the stated principal amount and the related contingent quarterly coupon.  If, however, the final index value of any underlying index is less than its downside threshold level, investors will be exposed to the decline in the worst performing underlying index on a 1-to-1 basis and will receive a payment at maturity that is less than 70% of the stated principal amount of the securities and could be zero.",
