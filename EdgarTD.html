      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">The Notes involve risks not associated with an investment in ordinary fixed rate notes. This section describes the most significant risks relating to the terms of the Notes. For additional
        information as to these risks, please see the prospectus supplement and the prospectus.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">You should consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in the Notes and the suitability of the Notes in light of your particular
        circumstances.</div>
      <div style="text-align: center; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Risks Relating to Structure and Credit Characteristics</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">Investors Are Subject to Our Credit Risk, and Our Credit Ratings and Credit Spreads May Adversely Affect the Market Value of the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">Investors are dependent on TD&#8217;s ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on the Interest Payment Dates and the Maturity Date, and, therefore, investors are subject to the credit risk of TD and
        to changes in the market&#8217;s view of TD&#8217;s creditworthiness. Any decrease in TD&#8217;s credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking TD&#8217;s credit risk is likely to adversely affect the market value of the Notes. If TD
        becomes unable to meet its financial obligations as they become due, investors may not receive any amounts due under the terms of the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">Because the Notes Accrue Interest at the at the CMS Interest Rate During the CMS Interest Periods and at the SOFR Interest Rate During the SOFR Interest Periods, You May Receive
        a Lesser Interest Rate During Such Period Relative to That of Conventional Fixed-Rate Debt Securities of Comparable Maturity.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">The interest payable, if any, on the Notes with respect to the CMS Interest Periods will be based on the CMS Interest Rate and with respect to the SOFR Interest Periods will be based on the SOFR
        Interest Rate. The CMS Reference Rate and the SOFR Interest Rate will vary and there will be significant risks not associated with a conventional fixed&#8722;rate debt security, in addition to risks specific to each floating rate. These risks include
        fluctuation of the CMS Reference Rate and the Benchmark, and the possibility that the CMS Interest Rate and/or the SOFR Interest Rate will decrease during an applicable Interest Period to a rate that may be lower than that of conventional
        fixed-rate debt securities of comparable maturity and may be as low as the applicable Minimum Interest Rate.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">If there is a decline in the CMS Interest Rate or the SOFR Interest Rate with respect to an applicable Interest Period, the effective yield on your Notes for such Interest Period may be less than
        that of a conventional fixed-rate debt security of comparable maturity, including those issued by TD. Your investment may not reflect the full opportunity cost to you when you take into account factors that affect the time value of money.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">Further, because the CMS Interest Rate will not be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, this risk of a lower effective yield on your Notes for any CMS Interest Period is even greater.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">The Interest with respect to each Interest Period is Variable, is Limited to the Maximum Interest Rate With Respect to each CMS Interest Period and May Be as Low as the Minimum
        Interest Rate.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">During each Interest Period, you will receive an Interest Payment, if any, on the applicable Interest Payment Date based on either the CMS Interest Rate or the SOFR Interest Rate. The CMS Interest
        Rate will be subject to the Maximum Interest Rate and, therefore, you will not benefit from any increase in the Interest Rate above the Maximum Interest Rate during any CMS Interest Period.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">Further, while the applicable interest rate for each Interest Period will fluctuate because it is based on a floating interest rate, such interest rate will not be less than the Minimum Interest
        Rate. If a daily SOFR value is negative as of any day during the applicable SOFR Interest Period, then the SOFR Interest Rate for that SOFR Interest Period will be computed using the negative rate, subject to the applicable Minimum Interest Rate.
        If the Benchmark is less than or equal to zero for an Interest Period, it may cause the SOFR Interest Rate for the applicable Interest Payment Date to be equal to the Minimum Interest Rate, which would result in no interest being paid on the
        applicable Interest Payment Date. You will not be compensated for any loss in value due to inflation and other factors relating to the value of money over time. You should consider, among other things, the overall interest payable on the Notes as
        compared to that of our or other similar debt securities of a comparable maturity.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">The Notes are Subject to Interest Rate Risk and May Be More Risky Than an Investment in Notes With a Shorter Term.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">The CMS Interest Rate applicable during each CMS Interest Period and/or the SOFR Interest Rate applicable during each SOFR Interest Period may be lower than the interest rates for similar debt
        securities then-prevailing in the market. Accordingly, you would earn less interest on the Notes than you could earn on other investments with a similar level of risk available at such time. The value of your Notes may decline during a period of
        falling interest rates and the amount that you would receive for them in any secondary market transaction if you tried to sell them would be adversely affected. We have no control over a number of factors that may affect market interest rates,
        including geopolitical conditions and economic, financial, political, regulatory, judicial and other events that affect markets generally that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their results. You
        will bear greater exposure to fluctuations in interest rates than if you purchased a similar investment with a shorter term.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Any payments on the Notes, including any Interest Payment and the repayment of the Principal Amount at maturity, may not fully compensate you for any loss in value due to inflation and other factors relating to the
        value of money over time.</div>

        Rate or the SOFR Interest Rate decreasing to a level equal to or less than the applicable Minimum Interest Rate, but in no case will the CMS Interest Rate or the SOFR Interest Rate be less than the applicable Minimum Interest Rate.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-right: 2.15pt; margin-top: 4pt;">SOFR is published by the Federal Reserve based on data received from other sources (as described further herein under &#8220;Information About the Floating Reference Rates
        &#8212;&#160;Compounded SOFR&#8221;). Neither TD Securities (USA) LLC or other affiliates of TD have any control over the determination, calculation or publication of SOFR and there can be no guarantee that SOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in
        a manner that is materially adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. Any change to the manner in which SOFR is calculated may result in a reduction of the market value of, and return on, the Notes. As described more fully herein under
        &#8220;Information About the Floating Reference Rates &#8212;&#160;Compounded SOFR&#8221;, following a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date, the Benchmark will be based on an alternative rate and the Calculation Agent may make Spread
        Adjustments and Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, which may affect other terms of the Notes, including the Spread, as described further herein under &#8220;Information About the Floating Reference Rates &#8212;&#160;Compounded SOFR&#8221;. Additionally, because
        SOFR is relatively new, there may be a greater likelihood of changes to the methods pursuant to which it is determined than there would be if it had a longer publication history. Any such changes may adversely affect the market value of, and return
        on, the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">The CMS Reference Rate May Be Modified or Discontinued, Which Could Adversely Affect the Market Value of, and Return on, the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">The CMS Reference Rate represents the fixed rate of interest payable on a hypothetical interest rate swap. In such a hypothetical swap, a fixed rate of interest is exchangeable for a floating rate
        based on SOFR (compounded in arrears for twelve months using standard market conventions), each payable annually on an Actual/360 basis (i.e. interest accrues based on the actual number of days elapsed in a year assumed to be 360 days). SOFR is
        intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. The CMS Reference Rate is published by the ICE Benchmark Administration Limited (the &#8220;IBA&#8221;) and SOFR is published by the New York
        Federal Reserve. TD has no control over the determination, calculation or publication of the CMS Reference Rate or SOFR and there can be no guarantee that the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner
        that is materially adverse to your interest in the Notes. Because the CMS Reference Rate is relatively new, there may be a greater likelihood of changes to the methods pursuant to which they are determined than there would be if they had longer
        publication histories. Similarly, market terms for floating-rate debt securities linked to the CMS Reference Rate or SOFR, such as the manner of determining the CMS Reference Rate, the Spread reflected in the floating interest rates or the manner
        of determining SOFR, may evolve over time, and trading prices of earlier issued CMS Reference Rate- or SOFR-linked notes may be lower than those of later-issued debt securities as a result. Any changes to the manner in which the CMS Reference Rate
        or SOFR is calculated could adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">Additionally, if the Calculation Agent determines that the CMS Reference Rate has been permanently or indefinitely discontinued prior to an Interest Determination Date with respect to a CMS Interest Period, then the
        Calculation Agent or its designee will select a substitute rate for each affected future Interest Determination Date with reference to (1) any alternative reference rate selected by the central bank, monetary authority or any similar institution
        and (2) accepted market practice and usage, as discussed further in the prospectus supplement under &#8220;Description of the Notes We May Offer &#8212; Interest Rates &#8212; Floating&#160;Rate Notes &#8212; CMS Rate Notes&#8221;. If the Calculation Agent (or its designee) selects
        an Alternative Rate, it may make Adjustments (as defined in the prospectus supplement) to the terms of the Notes, including to the Spread, as appropriate to account for differences with the Alternative Rate. There can be no assurance that the
        characteristics of any Alternative Rate will be similar to the CMS Reference Rate (or the then-current reference rate that it is replacing)</div>

        return on the Notes that is substantially lower than or that does not otherwise correlate over time with the payment that would have been made had the CMS Reference Rate (or the then-current reference rate that it is replacing) remained available
        in its current form.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">There is Limited Historical Data Regarding the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR and the Future Performance of the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR Cannot Be Predicted
        Based on Historical Performance.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">The CMS Reference Rate was first published by the IBA in November 2021. Similarly, the New York Federal Reserve began to publish SOFR in April 2018, though the New York Federal Reserve has also
        published indicative historical SOFR going back to August 2014. Accordingly, both the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR have limited historical performance. You should not rely on any historical changes or trends in SOFR or the CMS Reference Rate
        (whether based on actual or indicative historical data). The future performance of the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR cannot be predicted based on their past performance, and the performance of the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR during the term of the
        Notes may bear little or no relation to their limited historical performance. Since the initial publication of the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR, daily changes in SOFR have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark
        or market rates. As a result, the return on the Notes may fluctuate to a larger degree than floating-rate securities that are linked to less volatile rates.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">Compounded SOFR for a SOFR Interest Period May Not Reflect Any Subsequently Published Corrections to SOFR.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 4pt;">The Federal Reserve publishes SOFR each U.S. Government Securities Business Day at approximately 8:00 a.m. (New York time) for trades made on the immediately preceding U.S. Government Securities
        Business Day. After publication, if (i) the Federal Reserve discovers errors in the transaction data or calculation process or additional transaction data becomes available and (ii) such errors or additional data would change the published SOFR by
        at least one basis point (0.01%), subject to change based on periodic review by the Federal Reserve, then the Federal Reserve will republish SOFR at approximately 2:30 p.m. (New York time) on that same day. The Federal Reserve will not revise
        published SOFR on any U.S. Government Securities Business Day after the original date of publication and, even if the Federal Reserve&#8217;s policy changed to permit revisions to SOFR after the initial publication date, such changes would not be
        reflected in the Calculation Agent&#8217;s determination of Compounded SOFR on a U.S. Government Securities Business Day under the Notes because such determination is made as of 5:00 p.m. (New York time) on each U.S. Government Securities Business Day
        without regard to any subsequently published revisions.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">The Benchmark, which is initially Compounded SOFR, May Be Replaced if SOFR Ceases to be Available, and That May Have an Adverse Effect on the Market Value of, and Return on, the
        Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 4pt;">The terms of the Notes provide that if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date occur with respect to SOFR, the SOFR Interest Rate will be determined using the
        next-available Benchmark Replacement. As described further below under &#8220;Information About the Floating Reference Rates &#8212; Information About SOFR&#8221;, these replacement rates and spreads may be selected or formulated by (i) the Relevant Governmental
        Body (such as the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve), (ii) ISDA or (iii) in certain circumstances, the Calculation Agent. In addition, the terms of the Notes expressly authorize the Calculation Agent to make Benchmark
        Replacement Conforming Changes with respect to, among other things, the determination of SOFR Interest Periods and the timing and frequency of determining rates and making payments of interest. The interests of the Calculation Agent in making any
        such determination may be adverse to your interests as a holder of the Notes. The application of a Benchmark Replacement and Spread Adjustment, and any implementation of Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, could result in adverse consequences
        to the SOFR Interest Rate and, therefore, could adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the Notes. There can be no assurance that the characteristics of any Benchmark Replacement will be similar to SOFR or the then-current Benchmark
        that it is replacing or that any Benchmark Replacement will produce the economic equivalent of SOFR or the then-current Benchmark that it is replacing.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">Assuming no changes in market conditions or any other relevant factors, the price, if any, at which you may be able to sell the Notes will likely be less than the public offering price. The public
        offering price includes, and any price quoted to you is likely to exclude, the underwriting discount paid in connection with the initial distribution, offering expenses as well as the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes. In addition,
        any such price is also likely to reflect dealer discounts, mark-ups and other transaction costs, such as a discount to account for costs associated with establishing or unwinding any related hedge transaction.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes &#8212; Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or any electronic communications network. The Agent and other
        affiliates of TD may make a market for the Notes; however, they are not required to do so and may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops, it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at
        prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result, the difference between bid and ask prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify;">If you sell your Notes before the Maturity Date, you may have to do so at a substantial discount from the Issue Price, and as a result, you may suffer substantial losses.</div>

        Date without notice to you. The Calculation Agent will exercise its judgment when performing its functions and may take into consideration our ability to unwind any related hedges. Since this discretion by the Calculation Agent may affect payments
        on the Notes, the Calculation Agent may have a conflict of interest if it needs to make any such decision.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt; font-weight: bold;">Under Certain Circumstances, the Calculation Agent May Replace a Floating Reference Rate and Make Conforming Changes to the Terms of the Notes, Including Adjusting the Spread.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 4pt;">As discussed further herein under &#8220;Information About the Floating Reference Rates&#8221;, if a Floating Reference Rate has been permanently or indefinitely discontinued, then the Calculation Agent (or
        its designee) may select an Alternative Rate and make other Adjustments to the terms of the Notes. There can be no assurance that the Alternative Rate and any Adjustments will perform similarly to the affected Floating Reference Rate and the use of
        the Alternative Rate and/or Adjustments may adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the Notes. Furthermore, in certain situations, the interest paid during an affected Interest Period may not be based on then-current interest rates,
        which may adversely affect the market value of, and return on, the Notes for that Interest Period. In such a situation, the Calculation Agent may have a conflict of interest in making any such decision.</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; margin-bottom: 6pt;">Included on the following pages is a brief description of the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR. This information has been obtained from publicly available sources. Also set forth below
        are graphs that the past performance for the CMS Reference Rate and SOFR. The information given below is for the period indicated. We obtained the past performance information set forth below from Bloomberg without independent verification. You
        should not take the historical performance of SOFR or the CMS Reference Rate as an indication of future performance.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;"><u>1-Year SOFR CMS Rate (USD)</u></div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">The 1-Year U.S. Dollar SOFR ICE Swap Rate (&#8220;1-Year SOFR CMS Rate (USD)&#8221; or &#8220;CMS Reference Rate&#8221;) means, as of any Interest Determination Date, the rate for U.S. dollar swaps with a maturity of 1 year
        commencing as of such Interest Determination Date, which appears on Bloomberg page &#8220;USISSO01 &lt;INDEX&gt;&#8221; as of 11:00 a.m., New York City time on such Interest Determination Date. The CMS Reference Rate is a constant maturity swap rate, which
        measures the fixed rate of interest payable on a hypothetical fixed-for-floating U.S. dollar interest rate swap transaction with a maturity of 1 year. In such a hypothetical swap transaction, the fixed rate of interest, payable annually on an
        Actual/360 day count basis, is exchangeable for a floating payment stream based on SOFR (compounded in arrears for twelve months using standard market conventions), also payable annually on an Actual/360 day count basis. SOFR, as discussed further
        below, is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. With an Actual/360 day count basis, interest accrues based on the actual number of elapsed days in a hypothetical year
        assumed to be 360 days.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">Additionally, if the Calculation Agent determines that the 1-Year SOFR CMS Rate (USD) has been permanently or indefinitely discontinued prior to an Interest Determination Date during a CMS Interest
        Period, then the Calculation Agent or its designee may select an Alternative Rate and make Adjustments to the terms of the Notes, as discussed further herein and in the prospectus supplement under &#8220;Description of the Notes We May Offer &#8212; Interest
        Rates &#8212; Floating&#160;Rate Notes &#8212; CMS Rate Notes&#8221;.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">On June 20, 2024, the CMS Reference Rate was 5.058%. The graph below sets forth the historical performance of the CMS Reference Rate from November 18, 2021 through June 20, 2024. Publication of the
        CMS Reference Rate began on November 18, 2021. Accordingly, the CMS Reference Rate has limited historical performance and an investment with a return based on its performance may be more risky than a comparable investment with a return based on the
        performance of an interest rate with a more established record of performance. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">The future performance of the CMS Reference Rate cannot be predicted based on its historical performance and may
          bear little or no relation to its historical performance.</font></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">All disclosures contained in this pricing supplement regarding the initial Benchmark, including, without limitation, its make-up and method of calculation, have been derived from publicly
        available sources. The information reflects the policies of, and is subject to change by Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the &#8220;<u>Federal Reserve</u>&#8221;). SOFR is published by the Federal Reserve, but the Federal Reserve has no obligation to
        continue to publish, and may discontinue publication of, SOFR. For a more complete discussion of SOFR, see the website of the Federal Reserve, currently at newyorkfed.org or any successor website of the Federal Reserve (the &#8220;<u>Federal Reserve&#8217;s
          Website</u>&#8221;) and apps.newyorkfed.org/markets/autorates/sofr. Neither we nor the Agent accepts any responsibility for the calculation, maintenance or publication of SOFR or any successor or replacement rate. None of the website references in the
        description below, or any materials included in those websites, are incorporated by reference into this pricing supplement.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (&#8220;<u>SOFR</u>&#8221;) is published by the Federal Reserve and is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S.
        Treasury securities. The Federal Reserve reports that SOFR includes all trades in the &#8220;Broad General Collateral Rate&#8221; (as defined on the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Website), plus bilateral Treasury repurchase agreement transactions cleared through the
        delivery-versus-payment service offered by the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (the &#8220;<u>FICC</u>&#8221;), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (&#8220;<u>DTCC</u>&#8221;). SOFR is filtered by the Federal Reserve to remove a portion of the
        foregoing transactions considered to be &#8220;specials&#8221;, which are repurchases for specific-issue collateral, which take place at cash-lending rates below those for general collateral repurchases because cash providers are willing to accept a lesser
        return on their cash in order to obtain a particular security.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Federal Reserve reports that SOFR is calculated as a volume-weighted median of transaction-level tri-party repo data collected from The Bank of New York Mellon (&#8220;<u>BNYM</u>&#8221;) as well as
        General Collateral Finance repurchase agreement transaction data and data on bilateral Treasury repurchase transactions cleared through the FICC&#8217;s delivery-versus-payment service. The Federal Reserve notes that it obtains information from DTCC
        Solutions LLC, an affiliate of DTCC. The Federal Reserve notes on its publication page for SOFR that use of SOFR is subject to important limitations and disclaimers, including that the Federal Reserve may alter the methods of calculation,
        publication schedule, rate revision practices or availability of SOFR at any time without notice. SOFR is published at approximately 8:00 a.m. (New York time) on each U.S. Government Securities Business Day for trades made on the immediately
        preceding U.S. Government Securities Business Day. If the Federal Reserve discovers errors in the transaction data provided by either BNYM or DTCC, or in the calculation process, subsequent to the rate publication but on that same day, SOFR and
        accompanying summary statistics may be republished at approximately 2:30 p.m. (New York time). Similarly, if transaction data from BNYM or DTCC had previously not been available in time for publication, but became available later in the day, SOFR
        may be republished at approximately 2:30 p.m. (New York time). Rate revisions will only be effected on the same day as initial publication and will only be republished if the change in the rate exceeds one basis point (0.01%), though the Federal
        Reserve will review this revision threshold periodically and could modify it after any such review. The description of SOFR herein does not purport to be exhaustive.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">Because the Secured Overnight Financing Rate is published by the Federal Reserve based on data received from other sources, neither the Agent nor any other affiliate of TD has any control over its
        determination, calculation or publication. There can be no guarantee that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate will not be discontinued or fundamentally altered in a manner that is materially adverse to the interests of investors in the Notes. If
        the manner in which the Secured Overnight Financing Rate is calculated is changed, that change may result in a reduction of the amount of interest payable on the Notes and the trading prices of the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt;">The Federal Reserve began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in April 2018. The Federal Reserve has also published historical indicative Secured Overnight Financing Rates going back
        to August 2014. Investors should not rely on any historical changes or trends in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as an indicator of future changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Also, since the Secured Overnight Financing Rate is
        relatively new, the Notes are not expected to have established trading market when issued, and an established trading market may never develop or may not be very liquid. Market terms for debt securities, like the Notes, that reference SOFR, such as
        the spread over SOFR reflected in interest rate provisions, may evolve over time and, as a result, trading prices of the Notes may be lower than those of later-issued debt securities that reference SOFR. Similarly, if the Secured Overnight
        Financing Rate does not prove to be widely used in securities like the Notes, the trading price of the Notes may be lower than those of notes linked to indices that are more widely used. Investors in the Notes may not be able to sell the Notes at
        all or may not be able to sell the Notes at prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary market, and may consequently suffer from increased pricing volatility and market risk.</div>

We make no representation or warranty as to the

        performance.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">SOFR has limited historical information available and, accordingly, an investment in notes based on that rate may involve greater risk than an investment in notes based on a
        more conventional reference interest rate or a rate with a more established record of performance. Additionally, SOFR has experienced significant fluctuations. Any historical upward or downward trend during any period shown below is not an
        indication that the interest payable on the Notes during any SOFR Interest Period is more or less likely to increase or decrease at any time.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 10pt;">On June 20, 2024, SOFR was 5.32%. The graph below sets forth the historical performance of SOFR from April 2, 2018 through June 20, 2024. <font style="font-style: italic;">Past performance is

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">This discussion is based on interpretations of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#8220;Code&#8221;), regulations issued thereunder, and rulings and decisions currently in effect (or in
        some cases proposed), all of which are subject to change. Any such change may be applied retroactively and may materially and adversely affect the U.S. federal income tax consequences described herein. This discussion addresses only holders that
        purchase Notes at initial issuance, and own Notes as capital assets and not as part of a &#8220;straddle,&#8221; &#8220;hedge,&#8221; &#8220;synthetic security,&#8221; or a &#8220;conversion transaction&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes or as part of some other integrated investment.
        This discussion does not address the tax consequences to taxpayers subject to special tax accounting rules under Section 451(b) of the Code and does not discuss all of the tax consequences (such as any alternative minimum tax consequences) that may
        be relevant to particular investors or to investors subject to special treatment under the U.S. federal income tax laws (such as banks, thrifts or other financial institutions; insurance companies; securities dealers or brokers, or traders in
        securities electing mark-to-market treatment; regulated investment companies or real estate investment trusts; small business investment companies; S corporations; partnerships; or investors that hold their Notes through a partnership or other
        entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes; holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar; certain former citizens or residents of the U.S.; retirement plans or other tax-exempt entities, or persons holding the
        Notes in tax-deferred or tax-advantaged accounts; persons that purchase or sell the Notes as part of a wash sale for tax purposes; or &#8220;controlled foreign corporations&#8221; or &#8220;passive foreign investment companies&#8221; for U.S. federal income tax purposes).</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">U.S. Federal Income Tax Treatment of the Notes</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Based on certain factual representations received from us, our special U.S. tax counsel, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP, is of the opinion that the Notes should
        be treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Further, the Notes should be treated as &#8220;variable rate debt instruments&#8221;. Whether the Notes will be issued with original issue discount (&#8220;OID&#8221;) will depend upon the facts at the time of
        issuance of the Notes. If the determination were made as of the date hereof, the Notes should be treated as &#8220;variable rate debt instruments&#8221; issued with a de minimis amount of OID.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Interest and Original Issue Discount.</font><font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">&#160;</font>Whether the Notes are issued with OID for U.S. federal
        income tax purposes will depend on the facts at the time that the Notes are issued. If the Notes are not treated as issued with OID (or are issued with only a de minimis amount of OID), then interest income generally will be taxable to you at the
        time it is received or accrued in accordance with your regular method of tax accounting.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">If the Notes are treated as issued with OID, you will be required to include OID as ordinary income under a constant yield method during your ownership of the Notes, regardless
        of your normal method of accounting; accordingly, your taxable income in respect of the Notes may exceed the cash interest payments you receive on the Notes during one or more taxable years. The remainder of this section assumes that the Notes are
        issued with OID.</div>

      </div>
      <div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: justify;">In order to determine the amount of OID in respect of the Notes, an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument must be constructed. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is a hypothetical
        instrument that has terms that are identical to those of the Notes, except that the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument provides for fixed rate substitutes in lieu of the actual rates on the Notes. The fixed rate substitute for each floating rate
        under the Notes will be the value of that floating rate as of the Issue Date. The amount of OID on the Notes is determined for the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument under the rules applicable to fixed rate debt instruments and is generally
        taken into account as if you held the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument, subject to the adjustments to qualified stated interest (&#8220;QSI&#8221;) described below.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Subject to the following adjustments, the amount of QSI on your Notes each year should be the amount of interest that would be payable during that year under the lowest fixed
        rate substitute determined for the Notes&#8217; equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. If the amount you receive in any calendar year is greater than the assumed payment under the fixed rate substitute for the applicable accrual period, the excess will
        be treated as additional QSI and will be taxable to you as ordinary income in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. If the amount you receive in a calendar year is less than the assumed payment for the applicable accrual
        period, the difference will reduce the amount of QSI you are required to take into income.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In general, each year, your taxable income should include the amount of QSI paid or accrued (subject to the adjustments discussed above) and the annual OID accrual with respect
        to your Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font style="font-style: italic;">Sale, Exchange or Maturity of the Notes</font>. Upon the disposition of a Note by sale, exchange, maturity or other taxable disposition, a U.S.
        Holder should generally recognize taxable gain or loss equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized on such taxable disposition (other than amounts attributable to accrued but untaxed interest) and (2) the U.S. Holder&#8217;s adjusted tax
        basis in the Note. A U.S. Holder&#8217;s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the U.S. Holder&#8217;s cost of the Note, plus any accrued and unpaid OID, minus any payments received on the Notes other than QSI (as adjusted). Because the Note is
        held as a capital asset, such gain or loss will generally constitute capital gain or loss. Capital gain of a noncorporate U.S. Holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the holder has a holding period of greater than one year. The
        deductibility of a capital loss realized on the sale, exchange, maturity or other taxable disposition of a Note is subject to limitations.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Medicare Tax on Net Investment Income</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">U.S. Holders that are individuals or estates and certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their &#8220;net investment income,&#8221; or &#8220;undistributed net investment income&#8221; in
        the case of an estate or trust, which may include any income or gain realized with respect to the Notes, to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that, when added to their other
        modified adjusted gross income, exceeds $200,000 for an unmarried individual, $250,000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse), $125,000 for a married individual filing a separate return, or the dollar amount at which
        the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8% Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax. You should consult your tax advisor with respect to the 3.8% Medicare tax.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Specified Foreign Financial Assets</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">Certain U.S. Holders that own &#8220;specified foreign financial assets&#8221; in excess of an applicable threshold may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to such assets with their tax returns,
        especially if such assets are held outside the custody of a U.S. financial institution. You are urged to consult your tax advisor as to the application of this reporting obligation to your ownership of the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Backup Withholding and Information Reporting</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">Interest paid on, and the proceeds received from a <font style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">sale, exchange, maturity or other taxable disposition</font> of Notes held by a U.S. Holder will be subject to
        information reporting unless the U.S. Holder is an &#8220;exempt recipient&#8221; and may also be subject to backup withholding if the holder fails to provide certain identifying information (such as an accurate taxpayer number) or meet certain other
        conditions.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules are not additional taxes and may be refunded or credited against such U.S. Holder&#8217;s U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required
        information is furnished to the IRS.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Tax Treatment of Non-U.S. Holders</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">In general and subject to the discussion below, if you are a Non-U.S. Holder, you should generally not be subject to U.S. federal income or withholding tax with respect to payments on your Notes or
        to generally applicable information reporting and backup withholding requirements with respect to payments on your Notes if you comply with certain certification and identification requirements as to your non-U.S. status including providing us
        (and/or the applicable withholding agent) a properly executed and fully completed applicable IRS Form W-8. Gain realized from the taxable disposition of a Note generally should not be subject to U.S. tax unless (i) such gain is effectively
        connected with a trade or business conducted by you in the U.S., (ii) you are a non-resident alien individual and are present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of such taxable disposition and certain other conditions are
        satisfied or (iii) you have certain other present or former connections with the U.S.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt; font-weight: bold;">Both U.S. and Non-U.S. Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of an investment in the Notes, as well as any tax consequences
        arising under the laws of any state, local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction (including that of TD).</div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">We have appointed TD Securities (USA) LLC, an affiliate of TD, as the agent for the sale of the Notes. Pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement, TDS will purchase the Notes from TD at the
        public offering price less the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement and offered the Notes directly to investors or for distribution to other registered broker-dealers. TD will reimburse TDS for certain
        expenses in connection with its role in the offer and sale of the Notes, and TD will pay TDS a fee in connection with its role in the offer and sale of the Notes.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Pricing Date, the price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market, if any, may, for a temporary period
        expected to be approximately 18 months after the Issue Date, exceed the secondary market value of the Notes because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our obligations
        under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which we will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. This discretionary election and the temporary reimbursement period are determined on the basis of a number of factors,
        including the tenor of the Notes and any agreement we may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement
        period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the Issue Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;"><font style="font-style: italic;">Conflicts of Interest</font>. TD Securities (USA) LLC is an affiliate of TD and, as such, has a &#8220;conflict of interest&#8221; in this offering within the meaning of
        Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (&#8220;FINRA&#8221;) Rule 5121. In addition, TD will receive the net proceeds from the initial public offering of the Notes, thus creating an additional conflict of interest within the meaning of FINRA Rule 5121.
        This offering of the Notes will be conducted in compliance with the provisions of FINRA Rule 5121. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121, neither TDS nor any other affiliated agent of ours is permitted to sell the Notes in this offering to an account
        over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">We may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition, TDS or another of our affiliates may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after
        their initial sale. <font style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale, this pricing supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.</font></div>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (&#8220;EEA&#8221;).
        For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU, as amended (&#8220;MiFID II&#8221;); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC,
        as amended, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC, as amended. Consequently, no key information
        document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the &#8220;EU PRIIPs Regulation&#8221;) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
        Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the &#8220;UK&#8221;). For
        these purposes, a retail investor in the UK means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union
        (Withdrawal) Act 2018, subject to amendments made by the Markets in Financial Instruments (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018 (SI 2018/1403), as may be amended or superseded from time to time (the &#8220;EUWA&#8221;); (ii) a customer within the meaning of
        the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the &#8220;FSMA&#8221;) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8)
        of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of the Prospectus Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA
        (&#8220;UK Prospectus Regulation&#8221;). Consequently, no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the &#8220;UK PRIIPs Regulation&#8221;) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
        them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.<br>

      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">In the opinion of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP, as special products counsel to TD, when the Notes offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and issued by TD and
        authenticated by the trustee pursuant to the indenture and delivered, paid for and sold as contemplated herein, the Notes will be valid and binding obligations of TD, enforceable against TD in accordance with their terms, subject to applicable
        bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium, receivership or other laws relating to or affecting creditors&#8217; rights generally, and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
        proceeding at law or in equity). This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York. Insofar as this opinion involves matters governed by Canadian law, Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP
        has assumed, without independent inquiry or investigation, the validity of the matters opined on by McCarthy T&#233;trault LLP, Canadian legal counsel for TD, in its opinion expressed below. In addition, this opinion is subject to customary assumptions
        about the trustee&#8217;s authorization, execution and delivery of the indenture and, with respect to the Notes, authentication of the Notes and the genuineness of signatures and certain factual matters, all as stated in the opinion of Fried, Frank,
        Harris, Shriver &amp; Jacobson LLP dated March 4, 2022 filed as an exhibit to the current report on Form 6-K on March 4, 2022.</div>
      <div style="text-align: justify; margin-top: 6pt;">In the opinion of McCarthy T&#233;trault LLP, the issue and sale of the Notes has been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of TD, and when this pricing supplement has been
        attached to, and duly notated on, the master note that represents the Notes, the Notes will have been validly executed and issued and, to the extent validity of the Notes is a matter governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario, or the laws of
        Canada applicable therein, will be valid obligations of TD, subject to the following limitations: (i) the enforceability of the indenture is subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, winding up, moratorium and other similar
        laws of general application limiting the enforcement of creditors&#8217; rights generally; (ii) the enforceability of the indenture is subject to general equitable principles, including the fact that the availability of equitable remedies, such as
        injunctive relief and specific performance, is in the discretion of a court; (iii) courts in Canada are precluded from giving a judgment in any currency other than the lawful money of Canada; and (iv) the enforceability of the indenture will be
        subject to the limitations contained in the Limitations Act, 2002 (Ontario), and such counsel expresses no opinion as to whether a court may find any provision of the indenture to be unenforceable as an attempt to vary or exclude a limitation
        period under that Act. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable thereto. In addition, this opinion is subject to: (i) the assumption that the senior
        indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by, and constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of, the trustee, enforceable against the trustee in accordance with its terms; and (ii) customary assumptions about the
        genuineness of signatures and certain factual matters all as stated in the letter of such counsel dated February 4, 2022, which has been filed as Exhibit 5.2 to the registration statement on Form F-3 filed by TD on February 4, 2022.</div>
